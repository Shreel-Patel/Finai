People thought it would pump their bags but markets are forward-looking and all of this was priced in as soon as Trump won. It's not a coincidence that the lawsuit officially ended in August while the price of XRP was at $3.20, up against multi-year resistance. Market are designed to punish the herd. Good news usually marks major tops. Like when Judge Torres ruled in favour of XRP in July 2023...that was the top and people who bought into that got punished extremely hard - not a coincidence.

From a TA perspective, XRP is doing exactly what Cardano did in 2021:

I’ve been DCA’ing around $2,000 per month into crypto for about 5 months now.
Mainly ETH and SOL, with smaller positions in SUI and XRP.

I’m currently down overall, which I expected going in. My plan is to continue DCA’ing roughly the same amount for a good while, until I’m satisfied with a solid move up (not necessarily ATHs, just a meaningful recovery / upside).

That said, I’m trying to stay honest with myself and not get tunnel vision.

So my questions:
	•	Is this plan reasonable, or am I being delusional thinking patience alone will fix the drawdown?
	•	If you were in my position, would you keep DCA’ing the same amount, or reduce risk and maybe allocate $1,000/month elsewhere (stocks, ETFs, metals, etc.)?
	•	Which coins would you personally continue DCA’ing into, and which would you reconsider?
	•	Is it realistic to expect to be back in profit long-term sticking to this approach, assuming no panic selling?

I know nobody can predict the market — I’m just looking for grounded opinions from people who’ve been through cycles, not hype.

Appreciate any honest feedback 🙏

The purpose of this little research is to show how quickly coins die, and how little of them go up and stay up. But most importantly, how many of them stagnate, returning a loss over time when you factor in your country's or the global inflation.

Finally I added GOLD and Silver prices, not for their value, but as indication to inflation to take into consideration, and to show that compared to crypto, it's not as dramatic as some imagine. BTC while in bear now is up as much as gold is over 5 years.

What I learned is chasing high % in a short time in ALTS, will kill most people.

While everyone was focused on institutional accumulation data and ETF flow metrics, the derivatives market had already telegraphed the move days in advance.

Open interest on perpetual contracts spiked roughly 40% before the breakout even began. Funding rates stayed stubbornly positive despite multiple retests of support, indicating leveraged longs were willing to pay premium to maintain positions. This divergence between spot accumulation narratives and derivatives positioning created a readable setup.

The mechanics here are straightforward but often overlooked. When institutions accumulate spot over extended periods (29 days of consecutive buying in this case), they create a supply vacuum. But the first movers who recognize this pattern typically express their thesis through perpetuals because of capital efficiency. Platforms offering higher max leverage like BYDFi (up to 200x on some pairs) let traders capture the thesis with even less capital than the standard 50x venues, which partly explains why OI growth concentrates on these secondary exchanges during early accumulation phases.

What made this particular setup interesting was the concentration of open interest growth on secondary venues.

While the sub was full of posts declaring XRP dead in December when it dipped below 1.80 dollars, the smart money was doing the exact opposite. I dug into the ETF data and on chain metrics, and the results are honestly staggering.

According to SoSoValue data, US Spot XRP ETFs have recorded 29 consecutive trading days of net inflows. There has not been a single day of net outflows since early December. Even on December 31st, a dead day for markets, Franklin Templeton scooped up another 3.95 million dollars worth of tokens. On January 2nd, inflows spiked to over 13 million.

Technically, that dip to the 1.60 and 1.70 range in late December was a textbook Wyckoff Spring, a false breakout to the downside to trap bears. We just reclaimed the 2.00 level and are testing the 2.16 resistance. If you look at the chart, we are printing a Jump Across the Creek pattern. Standard Chartered is calling for 8.00 by the end of 2026 based on this structure, which sounds insane until you look at the supply data.

This is the kicker. While ETFs are vacuuming up coins, exchange balances are hitting multi year lows. The sell side liquidity is drying up. Interestingly, we are seeing a split in where people are trading. While boomers are buying the ETFs, the derivatives data shows that smart retail is pivoting to platforms that still offer high leverag",5,0.14285714285714285,DISCUSSION,False,XRP

When one coin dominates the conversation like this, I've learned it usually means the institutions have finished accumulating quietly and are letting retail carry the bags for a while.

Took profits near the local top, booked a surprise trip to Japan for my girlfriend and me (flights, hotels, ryokans  all paid), and cleared the last of my student debt that's been hanging over me forever.

Feels incredible.

Kept a small stack in case it really goes crazy, and I'll buy back heavier on a real dip. For now, turning paper gains into real life wins.

Reminder to everyone glued to the charts: profits only exist when you take them. Don't hodl until you're 80 waiting for ""one last pump."" Life is now.

What stands out is the consistency. Flows aren’t limited to Bitcoin alone, and they don’t look like panic-driven reallocations either.

Are institutions still building exposure at these levels, or is this more tactical positioning ahead of near-term catalysts?

Schwartz directed the technical evolution of Ripple’s cross-border payment systems and managed its global engineering organization. The XRP Ledger co-architect, who served as a core leader for more than a decade, will join the board of directors as his next official step.

“The time has come for me to step back from my day-to-day duties as Ripple CTO at the end of this year,” Schwartz said in a statement in October 2025, when he revealed his retirement plans. “I’m really looking forward to spending more time with the kids and grandkids and going back to the hobbies I set aside.

Settlement finality is defined by effect, not issuer. So courts care about irrevocability, not blockchains.

Nothing here violates:
US law
EU law
BIS principles
CCP frameworks

Since we know that the new system is simply being modular made to model the old with a neutral liquidity rtgs emergency backdrop. The first thing we should do is look at LEGAL TRUTH WHERE IT WILL ANCHOR!!!

Modern finance already separates systems into four legally distinct layers:

Execution – trading, matching, risk-taking

Clearing – calculating obligations, margining, netting

Settlement – final, irrevocable discharge of obligations

Money / Unit of Account – what obligations are denominated in

No crypto law changes this.
Crypto inherits these distinctions.

So lets fully model and scope it out here

Old System → New (Crypto-Native)

None of this interferes with the fact that execution environment assets are still commodities. Ledger vs Native Asset

Commodity status is orthogonal to settlement status. A property of systems and arrangements.

Security vs Commodity IS NOT THE SAME. DO NOT CONFLATE. 

The law ALREADY cleanly separates execution clearing settlement

THE NEW BILL IN JANUARY IS ABOUT MARKET STRUCTURE LAW NOT PAYMENT SYSTEM LAW WHICH I ALREADY LISTED IN QUOTE!!!

UNDERSTAND!!!!! Crypto does not abolish those layers. It re-implements it in software!

This highlighted how divided people are on any such solution.

And now we are seeing XRP begin testing potential solutions.

Vitalik is quoted saying there is a 20% risk current security will be broken within 4 years. ADA, Solana, and others also talking about steps they are taking to offer protections.   
  
Even Zcash laid claim to already offering quantum resistance with its shielded transactions. Public transactions would still be an issue however.

Every single top chain did all they could to deflect this reality just years ago. But now it has become very clear- chains must upgrade.

And it appears each is trying to grab a bit of the narrative. Or appease their holders by at least talking about it or testing some things.

So, we've shifted from calling it FUD to spinning it into a strength.  
  
Well, of course if it was easy, they wouldn't have fought so hard to convince people there was no threat.    
  
Time to start grasping the impacts.

Without a doubt, there will be problems. Transition issues, disagreements on reaching consensus, slower speed, downtimes, and general fork/upgrade risks.

These are the reasons no one has a high functioning chain that is ready for the future.
